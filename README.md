Ama's Designs — simple static site

Files:
- index.html — home / hero / featured / about preview
- portfolio.html — portfolio gallery
- about.html — about page
- contact.html — contact form (mailto)
- scripts/app.js — small JS for mobile menu and smooth scroll

Usage: open `index.html` in a browser or serve the folder with a static server (e.g., from the project root run `npx http-server` or use XAMPP as this repo is under htdocs).

Tailwind is included via CDN for quick styling.
